## Notes

I struggled figuring out how to use the fragments and view model to communicate with the main activity for a few days and was not able to get the project functioning properly. When I try to type into the box for translation
the app crashes and I have not been able to fix it. I went to office hours after I was unable to finish by the due date but the TA did not have time to help me because they were busy with other students.
